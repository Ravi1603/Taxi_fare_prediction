# Taxi_fare_prediction

In this project, I implemented basic Ml concepts like Detecting outliers, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), metric evaluation, etc. In this code, I used a CSV file which consists of 7 columns and 50,000 rows of data. The end goal is to analyze data, prepare data, and train a random forest model on the .csv file.
