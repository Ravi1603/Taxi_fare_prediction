# Taxi_fare_prediction

In this project I implemented basic Ml concepts like Detect outliers, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and metric evaluation etc. In this code, I used a csv file which consists of 7 columns and 50,000 rows of data. The end goal is to analyze data, prepare data and train a randon forest model on hte .csv file.
